Beta address space:
Any subfields are byte spaced

reset vector: 0'h80000000
iqr vector: 0'h80000004

0'h00000000 - 0'h0000FFFF : RAM/program memory (16k)

0'h00010000 - 0'h0001xxxx: memory mapped I/O

0000: input port A
0004: input port B
0008: output port A
000C: output port B
0010: SPI Config {res,res,clk_div*2,data_width}
0014: spi_start/status, reads 1 if done, write 1 to start spi
0018: SPI TX data
001C: SPI RX data, read only
0020: timer 1 current count, (read only)
0024: timer 1 set count, upon write resets counter and overflow flag
0028: timer 1 IRQ enable, write 1 enable
002C: timer 1 timer overflow, reads 1 when overflowed, write 1 to clear


0'h00020000 - 0'h0002xxxx: data transfer read block
this block is used by another source to transfer data into the beta.

0000 - 00FF: 
There is a single status register that can be written by the data source and read by both
There is a single status register that can be written by the beta and read by both

0000 - 00FF : memory block written by source (read only)
0100: source status register (read only)
0101: beta status register (read and write)

0'h00030000 ' 0'h0003xxxx: data transfer write block
this block is used to transfer data to another source.

0000 - 00FF: write only memory to transfer to client
0100: status register that can be read and written by the beta and read by the client device
0101: status register that can be read by the beta and is written by the client


External Connections:
Laser Beta output port A: {dac_csn,dac_latchn, laser_rgb[2:0]}

Both Beta's: Input port A: lower 8 bits connect to DIP switch

hardware beta's output port B: LED[7:0]
