Beta address space:
Any subfields are byte spaced

0'h00000000 - 0'h0000FFFF : RAM/program memory (16k)

0'h00010000 - 0'h0001xxxx: memory mapped I/O

0000: input port A
0004: input port B
0008: output port A
000C: output port B
0010: SPI Config {res,res,clk_div*2,data_width}
0014: spi_start/status, reads 1 if done, write 1 to start spi
0018: SPI TX data
001C: SPI RX data, read only
0020: timer 1 current count, (read only)
0024: timer 1 set count, upon write resets counter
0028: timer 1 IRQ enable, write 1 to start
002C: timer 1 timer overflow, reads 1 when overflowed, write 1 to clear


0'h00020000 - 0'h0002xxxx: data transfer read block
this block is used by another source to transfer data into the beta.
It is 256 words of memory that can be written but not read by another source. 
There is a single status register that can be written by the data source and read by both
There is a single status register that can be written by the beta and read by both

0000 - 00FF : memory block (read only)
0100: data source register (read only)
0101: beta status register

0'h00030000 ' 0'h0003xxxx: data transfer write block
this block is used to transfer data to another source.
There are 256 words of write only memory 
There is a single status register that can be written and read by the beta, and read by another source
There is a single status register that can be written by external source and read by the beta


External Connections:
Laser Beta output port A: {dac_csn,dac_latchn, laser_rgb[2:0]}

Both Beta's: Input port A: lower 8 bits connect to DIP switch

Both beta's output port B: LED[7:0]
