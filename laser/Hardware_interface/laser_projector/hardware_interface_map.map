Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   56
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   176 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 176
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        168 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      167 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             156
      Number using O5 output only:              10
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         1
  Number of route-thrus:                        11 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                11

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    80 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          241
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            65 out of     241   26%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  73 out of     241   30%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         103 out of     241   42%
    Number of unique control sets:              12
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              24 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        65 out of     480   13%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                       2 out of      60    3%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                  2
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               2
    Total Memory used (KB):                     72 out of   2,160    3%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2
