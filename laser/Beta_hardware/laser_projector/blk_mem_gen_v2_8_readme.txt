   Graphical symbol information file. Used by the ISE tools and some
   third party tools to create a symbol representing the core.

blk_mem_gen_v2_8.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

blk_mem_gen_v2_8.sym:
   Please see the core data sheet.

blk_mem_gen_v2_8.v:
   Verilog wrapper file provided to support functional simulation.
   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

blk_mem_gen_v2_8.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

blk_mem_gen_v2_8.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

blk_mem_gen_v2_8.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

blk_mem_gen_v2_8.xco:
