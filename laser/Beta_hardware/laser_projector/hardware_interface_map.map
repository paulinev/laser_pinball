      Number using O5 and O6:                  118
    Number used as Memory:                     136 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:            136
        Number using O6 output only:             8
        Number using O5 and O6:                128
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:        12
  Number of route-thrus:                       124 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:               122
    Number using O5 and O6:                      2

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,224 out of   7,200   17%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,316
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,972 out of   3,316   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 416 out of   3,316   12%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         928 out of   3,316   27%
    Number of unique control sets:             106
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             200 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              28
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               4
    Total Memory used (KB):                  1,080 out of   2,160   50%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        3
  Number of DSP48Es:                             2 out of      48    4%
