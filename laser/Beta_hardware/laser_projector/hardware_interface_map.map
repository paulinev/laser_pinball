Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   22
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   585 out of  28,800    2%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 585
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        816 out of  28,800    2%
    Number used as logic:                      807 out of  28,800    2%
      Number using O6 output only:             658
      Number using O5 output only:              81
      Number using O5 and O6:                   68
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         9
  Number of route-thrus:                        90 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                90

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   373 out of   7,200    5%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          977
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           392 out of     977   40%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 161 out of     977   16%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         424 out of     977   43%
    Number of unique control sets:              89
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             171 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              34
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               4
    Total Memory used (KB):                  1,296 out of   2,160   60%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      4 out of      32   12%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        4
  Number of DCM_ADVs:                            1 out of      12    8%

Peak Memory Usage:  747 MB
