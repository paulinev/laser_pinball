WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <HDR1_48> is placed at site <AJ32>.
   The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <HDR1_48.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   22
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   584 out of  28,800    2%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 584
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        806 out of  28,800    2%
    Number used as logic:                      796 out of  28,800    2%
      Number using O6 output only:             647
      Number using O5 output only:              81
      Number using O5 and O6:                   68
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:        10
  Number of route-thrus:                        91 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                91

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   390 out of   7,200    5%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          977
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           393 out of     977   40%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 171 out of     977   17%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         413 out of     977   42%
    Number of unique control sets:              91
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             176 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                        80 out of     480   16%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                      36 out of      60   60%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                 36
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              34
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               4
    Total Memory used (KB):                  1,296 out of   2,160   60%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      4 out of      32   12%
