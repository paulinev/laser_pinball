      Number using O5 output only:              27
      Number using O5 and O6:                    1
    Number used as Memory:                      83 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:             83
        Number using O5 output only:             4
        Number using O5 and O6:                 79
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        29 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                28
    Number using O5 and O6:                      1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   322 out of   7,200    4%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          886
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           685 out of     886   77%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   6 out of     886    1%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         195 out of     886   22%
    Number of unique control sets:               7
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              13 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        76 out of     480   15%

  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                      15 out of      60   25%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                 15
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              14
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               1
    Total Memory used (KB):                    522 out of   2,160   24%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2
