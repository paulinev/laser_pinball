      Number using O5 and O6:                   64
    Number used as Memory:                     136 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:            136
        Number using O6 output only:             8
        Number using O5 and O6:                128
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         7
  Number of route-thrus:                        99 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                96
    Number using O5 and O6:                      3

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   853 out of   7,200   11%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,654
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,716 out of   2,654   64%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 177 out of   2,654    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         761 out of   2,654   28%
    Number of unique control sets:              32
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              50 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              28
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               4
    Total Memory used (KB):                  1,080 out of   2,160   50%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      4 out of      32   12%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        4
