WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <HDR1_48> is placed at site <AJ32>.
   The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <HDR1_48.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

    Number used as Flip Flops:                 909
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      1,176 out of  28,800    4%
    Number used as logic:                    1,167 out of  28,800    4%
      Number using O6 output only:             960
      Number using O5 output only:             103
      Number using O5 and O6:                  104
    Number used as Memory:                       1 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:             1
        Number using O6 output only:             1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         8
  Number of route-thrus:                       111 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:               111

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   552 out of   7,200    7%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,466
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           557 out of   1,466   37%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 290 out of   1,466   19%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         619 out of   1,466   42%
    Number of unique control sets:             149
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             358 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        82 out of     480   17%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                      15 out of      60   25%
    Number using BlockRAM only:                 15
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              14
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               1
    Total Memory used (KB):                    522 out of   2,160   24%
