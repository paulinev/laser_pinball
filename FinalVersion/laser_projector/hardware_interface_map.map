Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
Running delay-based LUT packing...
ERROR:Pack:2310 - Too many comps of type "RAMB36_EXP" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:115 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

   NOTE:  An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped
   design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process
   successfully through PAR.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 1,454 out of  28,800    5%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               1,454
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,970 out of  28,800   10%
    Number used as logic:                    2,819 out of  28,800    9%
      Number using O6 output only:           2,571
      Number using O5 output only:             119
      Number using O5 and O6:                  129
    Number used as Memory:                     137 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:            136
        Number using O6 output only:             8
        Number using O5 and O6:                128
      Number used as Shift Register:             1
        Number using O6 output only:             1
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:        14
  Number of route-thrus:                       133 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:               131
    Number using O5 and O6:                      2

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,572
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,118 out of   3,572   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 602 out of   3,572   16%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         852 out of   3,572   23%
    Number of unique control sets:             113
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             205 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        82 out of     480   17%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                      66 out of      60  110% (OVERMAPPED)
    Number using BlockRAM only:                 66
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              62
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               8
    Total Memory used (KB):                  2,376 out of   2,160  110% (OVERMAPPED)
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      5 out of      32   15%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        5
  Number of DCM_ADVs:                            2 out of      12   16%
  Number of DSP48Es:                             2 out of      48    4%
