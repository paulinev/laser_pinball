Design Summary

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   43
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    55 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  55
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        122 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      121 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              90
      Number using O5 output only:               1
      Number using O5 and O6:                   30
    Number used as Memory:                       1 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:             1
        Number using O6 output only:             1
  Number of route-thrus:                         1 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                 1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    58 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          130
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            75 out of     130   57%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   8 out of     130    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          47 out of     130   36%
    Number of unique control sets:              15
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              44 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        82 out of     480   17%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2
  Number of DCM_ADVs:                            1 out of      12    8%
