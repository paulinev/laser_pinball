WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <HDR1_48> is placed at site <AJ32>.
   The clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock
   buffer/GCLK if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is
   normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <HDR1_48.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,569 out of   7,200   21%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        4,388
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,435 out of   4,388   55%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             340 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
