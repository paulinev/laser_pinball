Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   991 out of   7,200   13%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,764
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,803 out of   2,764   65%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 233 out of   2,764    8%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         728 out of   2,764   26%
    Number of unique control sets:              38
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              62 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:               4
    Total Memory used (KB):                  1,080 out of   2,160   50%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      4 out of      32   12%
